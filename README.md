# HoloClock
An Almost Holographic Word Clock

I am a fan of the "Pepper's Ghost". The reflection is probably the easiest way to create a holographic effect. I had the idea to build a clock based on this principle for a long time. I think the clock has become something special, although the projection of the time is based on a technique from around 1860.



I see the whole thing as a proof of concept. The basic idea I had here is clear, so that this clock can also be implemented differently and with other materials.
